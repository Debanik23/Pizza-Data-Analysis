# Pizza Sales Analysis: Understanding Customer Behavior and Business Insights
## Tools Used: MySQL, Power BI
Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze pizza sales data to provide insights that can help the pizza shop better understand their customers, identify areas for improvement, and enhance their business operations.

Data Source
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle, originally sourced from Maven Analytics. The dataset has been cleaned and combined from multiple sources into one cohesive dataset.

Guiding Questions
What days and times are the busiest for pizza sales?
How many pizzas are sold during peak periods?
What are the best and worst-selling pizzas?
What is the average order value?
How effectively is the seating capacity utilized?
Statistical Analysis
The project includes statistical analysis to calculate the average, total, maximum, and minimum revenue for each day of the week, as well as the table turnover rate.

Conclusion
The analysis revealed that the busiest days for pizza sales are Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, with the busiest time of day being between 12pm and 1pm. The best-selling pizza is the Classic Deluxe Pizza, followed by the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Hawaiian Pizza. However, the table turnover rate indicates that customers are not spending much time in the pizza place.

Recommendations
Staffing: Consider hiring more staff on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday to handle increased demand.
Promotions: Offer discounts for early dining or table sharing to increase table turnover rate and revenue.
Marketing: Promote the pizza shop on social media platforms to attract new customers.
Customer Experience: Enhance the overall customer experience by improving service quality and the dining environment.
Future Steps
Conduct further analysis to identify specific factors affecting pizza sales.
Implement targeted marketing campaigns based on customer preferences.
Experiment with menu variations and promotions to optimize sales.
